Network Reliability Modeling Project
This repository contains MATLAB simulations for analyzing different network reliability configurations, including single link, 
series links, parallel links, and compound networks. The project was developed for CENG-4213 Network Engineering course.
Each simulation consists of two files:

A function file (containing the core simulation logic)
A plotting file (handling the visualization of results)
